// Disk II controller card, for slot 6 ($C0E0-$C0EF, $C600-$C6FF).
//
// This is the card side of a Disk ][ controller, at the level the P6 boot ROM
// and DOS/ProDOS RWTS actually drive: the four I/O strobes, a shift register
// the data register reads from and writes to, four stepper phases, a motor and
// a drive select.  It is a slot card in every sense the bus cares about -- it
// decodes /DEVSEL and /IOSEL, answers $C600-$C6FF, and claims $C0E0-$C0EF on
// the read bus -- so a card module like this is what the slot_bus scaffolding
// in src/slot_bus.v was written for.
//
// The drive as a byte stream
// --------------------------
// A real drive produces GCR-encoded bytes (nibbles) at 250 kbit/s, one every
// 32 us: self-sync $FF fields, a $D5 $AA $96 header, then a $D5 $AA $AD data
// field of 343 six-and-two encoded bytes, and so on around the track.  The
// 6502 reads them one at a time from the data register at $C0EE.  That byte
// stream *is* the disk interface: nothing above this card knows what a sector
// is, and copy protection works precisely because software times and samples
// individual bytes and bits.  So the track here is a byte stream that advances
// one byte per 32 us and wraps at the end of the track, and the byte at a
// position is a pure function of that position.
//
// The sector payloads live in SDRAM (src/disk2/disk2_store.v).  This module
// holds the sector under the play head in a 256-byte buffer and six-and-two
// encodes from it on the fly, one encoded byte at a time, so a track never has
// to be resident and the device spends no block RAM on it.
//
// Timing
// ------
// 32 us at ce_1m (1.023 MHz) is 32.7 enables, so the stream advances on every
// 33rd enable (32.26 us) to stay at the real drive's rate.  A sector then
// takes the same number of CPU cycles it would on a //e with a real drive,
// which is what keeps timing-sensitive reads behaving.
//
// The stepper
// ----------
// Four phase lines, each latched by an access to $C0E0-$C0E7, and a head that
// moves one half-track toward whichever neighbouring phase is energised when a
// phase comes on.  DOS moves a track with two such steps and recalibrates with
// 80 steps inward against the stop, so a seek to track N is 2N half-tracks.  The
// head's position is reported in whole tracks, which is all DOS, ProDOS and
// every other filesystem use.  The details are at the stepper below.
//
// Writes
// ------
// With Q7 in write mode a byte written to the data register goes into the
// stream at the current position, and the stream advances exactly as on a
// read.  That is what RWTS needs: it writes a field and reads it back, and
// because the write went into the same stream the read sees, a write is
// immediately readable, exactly as on hardware.  disk2_store.v watches the
// stream and decodes a written data field back into its SDRAM sector, so the
// change survives the write and the next pass over the track returns it.
