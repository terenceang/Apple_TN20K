// Disk ][ image store: where the floppy's sectors live, and the path to them.
//
// The card (src/disk2/disk2_card.v) works in disk bytes and never in sectors,
// and it cannot afford to hold a track: 7040 disk bytes would be four block
// RAMs on a device that already spends 42 of 46.  So the card asks this module
// for one sector at a time, and this module keeps the images in the board's
// SDRAM, where there are 8 MB and the aux RAM's 64 KB is all that is otherwise
// used.
//
// Where in SDRAM
// --------------
// The images live in bank 1 (the controller's addr[21:20] = 01), which the aux
// RAM never touches -- aux RAM is bank 0, rows 0..63.  Inside a bank, a byte
// address splits into a row, a column and one of the two halves of a 16-bit
// word, exactly as aux_ram.v does it, and a sector is 256 bytes = 128 words.
//
//   drive 0, byte 0      = track 0, sector 0, byte 0
//   drive 1, byte 143360 = track 0, sector 0, byte 0
//
// 35 tracks x 16 sectors x 256 bytes = 143,360 bytes per drive and 286,720 for
// both, which is 140 KB out of bank 1's 2 MB.  Two drives, one card.
//
// All four clients move whole 16-bit words, never single bytes: the SDRAM
// controller hands back a full word on a read and takes a full word on a write,
// and a sector is an even number of bytes, so pairing is free and there is one
// path through the engine instead of two.
//
// Sector interleave
// -----------------
// The card lays a track out as 16 sectors at positions 0..15, which is the
// ProDOS (.po) order: sector n at position n.  A DOS order (.do) image stores
// its sectors in the interleave DOS's own RWTS uses, so the host is asked to
// hand over images already in the order the card wants (web/src/disk.js does
// that conversion, because a browser is a far better place for an interleave
// table than this module).  What arrives here is therefore plain physical
// order and this module stays format-agnostic.
//
// The write path
// --------------
// When DOS writes, the card reports each disk byte that enters the stream along
// with where in the data field it landed.  This module decodes the field with
// the tables the card encodes with (src/disk2/gcr_defs.vh, shared, so the two
// cannot drift), and when the field ends it writes the 256 bytes back.  That is
// comfortably in time: a data field is 343 disk bytes, about 11 ms of drive
// time, and writing the 128 words is about 40 us.  The card's next fetch of
// that sector therefore already returns the new data, which is what makes
// RWTS's write-then-read-back verify pass.
