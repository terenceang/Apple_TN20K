// tb_diskimg -- the debugger's Disk ][ image transfer, both directions.
//
// This is the path a host actually uses to get a disk onto the board: the
// debugger's d1/d2 and e1/e2 commands, one byte at a time over the debugger's
// own port, into and out of the image store's SDRAM.  The card is not involved
// and neither is the CPU: what is checked is that the bytes the host sends
// arrive in the image in the right place, and that the bytes that come back are
// the ones that went in.
//
// It is a separate bench from tb_disk2 because it is a different system: that one
// drives the card with real bit timings and checks that sectors decode, and it
// ties the store's debugger port off.  What is shared is the SDRAM stand-in,
// which is the same 8-clocks-per-word model aux_ram.v paces the real controller
// with, so the byte map under test is the byte map the card sees.
//
// The host here is a real one: it reads the wire at 115200 8N1, it waits for the
// banner before it sends anything, and it paces the upload on the board's
// acknowledgements.  Those are not politeness.  A host that blasts the file gets
// its bytes dropped in the middle, because the board has room for exactly one
// byte in hand, and it ends up with an image the board believes in.
